## üéÅ Introduction

**ClipRocks** is a script and plugin engine for DaVinci Resolve.

It allows you to copy images, videos, or other interactive elements from your computer or the web, and paste them directly into your DaVinci Resolve timeline. Media can optionally be processed by AI‚Äîfor example, to remove backgrounds or upscale images‚Äîbefore insertion.

This project is still evolving. It's shared here in the hope that it can help others. 

I use Cliprocks regularly and that‚Äôs enough for me. <br>
I offer this tool for those who need it. <br>
Just remember: I have no obligation.
