## 🎁 Introduction

**ClipRocks** is a script and plugin engine for DaVinci Resolve.

It allows you to copy images, videos, or other interactive elements from your computer or the web, and paste them directly into your DaVinci Resolve timeline. Media can optionally be processed by AI—for example, to remove backgrounds or upscale images—before insertion.

This project is still evolving. It's shared here in the hope that it can help others. 

I offer this tool for those who need it. <br>
Just remember: I have no obligation.

## 🛠 Engine Installation (Work in Progress 🚧)

### ✅ 1. Download
___
```cmd
cd /d "C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Fusion\Scripts\Comp\"
git clone https://github.com/coderocksAI/ClipRocks.git
```
📌  The Comp folder must contain a subfolder named ClipRocks, not the plugin files directly.
Example: ...\Comp\ClipRocks\cliprocks.py


### ✅ 2. Create config.conf (paths for modules, assets, etc.)
___
📌 This file is automatically generated on first launch of the script.
It stores default paths used by the plugin (modules, assets, venv, etc.), which you can customize later.

1.  Launch the script once to generate the configuration file.
In DaVinci Resolve, go to:
`Workspace > Scripts > Comp > Cliprocks > cliprocks`

2.  A file named config.conf will be automatically created at the following location:
```bat
C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Fusion\Scripts\Comp\ClipRocks\config.conf
```

### ✅ 3. Set up the Python Environment (venv)
___
1. Open the config.conf file and locate the value of the venv key.
This is the path where the required Python modules will be installed.

2. In a terminal (cmd), carefully run the following commands one by one:

```bat
cd /d "path\to\the\folder\"
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pillow requests
```

## 🛠  Using the Engine
To quickly trigger ClipRocks’ contextual menu, you can assign a custom keyboard shortcut in DaVinci Resolve.  
Choose any key you like, then copy an image from your web browser.  
Press the shortcut: the script will detect the image and launch the context menu.

## ⚠️ DaVinci Resolve Limitations
This script is designed to work with both the free and Studio versions of DaVinci Resolve.  
However, since version 19+, Blackmagic removed GUI API access from the free version.  
This imposes a few limitations on interface capabilities.

➡️ **Important**: the script must be manually activated each time you launch DaVinci.  
Go to: `Workspace > Scripts > Comp > Cliprocks > cliprocks`. Then enjoy, the shortcut key takes over.
